I am a master student majoring in Civil and Systems Engineering from Johns Hopkins University. Before that, I received my BS in Civil Engineering from Central South University in China. My research intersts lie in logistics and supply chain, especially in data science in logistics. Also, I am interested in transportation network modeling and human mobilities. 

Currently, I am looking for a Ph.D. position in the areas above.
